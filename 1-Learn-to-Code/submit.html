<h1>Getting Feedback</h1>
<em>Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will submit your work for review. When you submit a project, you will receive<br>
a grade that indicates either that you've passed that project or that you need to work on your project and submit again.</em>


<h2> Important: </h2>
<div class="left_side">
<p>You will <b>not</b> receive a grade for your <b>Getting Started with HTML</b> submission, but you <b>will</b> receive personalized <br>
   feedback.</p>
<p>We’d like you to complete this project within one week of beginning the Nanodegree, but there will not be any <br>
   consequence for missing this deadline.</p>
<p>Try to complete future projects on time.<p>
<p>This project serves as a formative checkpoint designed to give you immediate feedback and ensure you have the <br>
   confidence and the support you need to keep moving forward.</p>
</div>

<h2>Project Details: </h2>
<div class="left_side">
<p>If you haven’t already created an HTML file to contain your notes from this section, refer back to the beginning of the<br>
   lessons for setting up your file.</p>
<p>To complete this project, you’ll need to submit your notes as an HTML file using the tags you learned about in these<br>
   lessons, such as <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">&lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;,</span>
   and <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">&lt;span&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code.</p>
</div>

<h2>Submission Instructions: </h2>
<p>When you have your HTML file ready for submission, you can click on the <b>Submit Project</b> button below to upload it for<br> review.</p>

<p>One thing to note when you click on this button is that you’ll see <b>three</b> different ways to submit your project. You can:<br>

<div class="left_side2">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;upload a zip file,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;select a GitHub repository, or</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;upload a specific file type (<span style="color:red; background-color:pink">.zip</span>, <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">.html</span>).</p>
</div>

<p>In general, you’ll be choosing the first option — uploading a zip (or compressed) file — to submit your projects. If you’re<br>
   unsure how to create a zip file, go through the instructions in the section below.</p>

<p>For this particular project, you only need to submit one file type (an HTML file), so you could technically use the third <br>
   option to directly upload your file ending in an <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">.html</span> extension. This approach will work just fine for this project, but we’d <br>
   encourage you to familiarize yourself with submitting projects as zip files, especially because you’ll be doing so for future <br>
   projects in this program.</p>

<h2>Submitting Your Project</h2>
<p>Once you have your submission ready in either an <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">.html</span> or <span style="color:red; background-color:pink">.zip</span> file format, go ahead and upload your project for review!</p>
